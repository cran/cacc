Description: A set of functions to conduct Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations (CACC) as described in Miethe, Hart, and Regoeczi (2008) <doi:10.1007/s10940-008-9044-8>, and identify and quantify situational clustering in dominant case configurations as described in Hart (2019) <doi:10.1177/0011128719866123>. Initially conceived as an exploratory technique for multivariate analysis of categorical data, CACC has developed to include formal statistical tests that can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. This technique allows examining composite profiles of different units of analysis in an alternative way to variable-oriented methods.
